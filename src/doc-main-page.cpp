  Restad (Relational Storage for Tagged Documents) is an indexing-querying tool for tagged documents
  using a relational database for storage and querying.
  It actually uses PostgreSQL because it's "the world's most advanced open source database".
  Restad has been developped by the <a href="http://www.lia.univ-avignon.fr/">Computer Science lab of the university of Avignon.</a>

  \section dwnlds Download and install
  See the <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/restad/files/">download page</a>.

  \section dvlpers Contribute to the project
  Restad is opensource and anyone can contribute or fork and edit code to fit to special needs.

  \page developers Developer guide
  Restad uses Qt and its qmake/project-file system.
    - The restad.pro file is managing the whole project, but each command has its own project file (in src dir).
    - global.pri is included by all other project file
    - Most of the source files are included by src.pri,
      because they may be used in the final bin file or in the test bin file. Any class which is used by
      more than one project file must be included in src.pri instead of the project file. A class in src.pri
      must include classes which are also in src.pri or it will get linking errors.

  Code documentation is generated by Doxygen, the config file is Doxyfile. Simply run doxygen in the
  project root dir and everything is created/updated in doc/html.

  The project has some test units, see \ref tests.

  If you want to contribute, you can check \ref todo.
  The project uses Git. You can browse the code here https://sourceforge.net/p/restad/code/ref/master~/ .
  The classes of the project are grouped in subdirs, which are represented as modules in this doc, see
  <a href="./modules.html">Modules section</a>.
  Here is a raw class diagram used as a draw of the project, not up to date, not true UML but gives an overview of classes.

  \page tests Tests
  Restad project uses the Qt and CuteTest (https://bitbucket.org/mayastudios/cutetest/overview)
  for testing, you'll need to install both, and specify in test/test.pro the path for CuteTest
  includes and libraries.
