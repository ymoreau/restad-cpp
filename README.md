# Restad #
## Relational Storage for Tagged Documents ##


**Clone of the project https://sourceforge.net/projects/restad/ which is a C++/Qt version of the Ruby prototype (https://github.com/ymoreau/Restad).**

The design goals of Restad are : XML documents should be stored without lost information, any well-formed XML document should be stored and queried, and query processing on fulltext or XML logical structure should be efficient.
